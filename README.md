# WeatherGoBrrrrr

Just a simple web app that gives info on the weather of any given location  

The weather API used in the app is from [AccuWeather APIs](https://developer.accuweather.com).

To use this app, you will need a valid API key from their site.  

Add your API key in the app.js file. It's an argument to create a Forecast(class) instance.
